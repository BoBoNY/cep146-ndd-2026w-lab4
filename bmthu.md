## Difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request" 

A git "merge" is combining two branches. `git merge branchA` takes the changes from the branchA and merge into your current branch. 
A GitHub "pull request" is asking the original repo owner to merge the changes you made to the original repo.
